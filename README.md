## INCL Automated Theorem Prover

An automated theorem prover on first order modal logic and other non-classical formal logic systems, written in Rust. Implements the algorithm theorized by renowned philosopher and logician Graham Priest in his 2008 book ["An Introduction to Non-Classical Logic. From If to Is (second edition)"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/an-introduction-to-nonclassical-logic/61AD69C1D1B88006588B26C37F3A788E).
